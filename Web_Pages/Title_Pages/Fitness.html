    <p><b class="lax"  data-lax-preset_small= "blurInOut" >1. Exercise Daily</b></p><br><br>
    <img src="..\..\Images\img4.jpg" class="lax" data-lax-preset="blurInOut"><br>
<p class="lax" data-lax-preset="blurInOut">Exercise daily for at least an hour. You do not have to kill yourself from running, jogging, etc., but you should have some sort of moderate physical activity in your everyday life. If you're looking to shed a few pounds fast, do a higher-level intensity workout. For example, go on a walk at a brisk pace for an hour. Or, you can jog and set certain intervals to sprint during that hour. Make sure you're not in severe pain during your workout. Just a warning, your muscles will ache after a high intensity workout. It may be irritating, but that means your body is changing for the better. Be sure to stay hydrated, stretch, and eat foods with a decent amount of protein after each workout. The protein will help keep your muscles, not fat, rebuilding.</p>

<p><b class="lax" data-lax-preset="blurInOut">2. Eat more clean food</b></p><br><br>
    <img src="..\..\Images/img2.jpg" class="lax" data-lax-preset="blurInOut"><br>
<p class="lax" data-lax-preset="blurInOut">Eating only three daily meals? Not a great idea. “Half the people I deal with aren’t losing weight because they don’t eat enough,” says veteran personal trainer Mike Duffy. Duffy advises his clients “to eat five times a day, about every three hours, to stimulate their metabolism” including two mini-meals between three basic meals. With activity levels decreasing throughout the day, he advises to “eat less as the day goes on.”</p>
<br><br>

<p><b class="lax" data-lax-preset="blurInOut">3. Control your portion sizes</b></p><br><br>
    <img src="..\..\Images/img3.jpg" class="lax" data-lax-preset="blurInOut"><br>
<p class="lax" data-lax-preset="blurInOut">You’ll be eating more often, so paying attention to portions is extremely important. “Make sure chicken breasts, (and) meats, are no larger than your palm, and that pastas are no larger than your fists,” says Jay Cardiello, a personal trainer to countless celebrities and professional athletes. He also suggests using “smaller bowls, plates, and cups” because studies show people “serve themselves 20-40% more food when they’re using larger plates.” Here’s how to estimate portion sizes.</p>
<br><br>

<p><b class="lax" data-lax-preset="blurInOut">4. Don’t drink sugar calories</b></p><br><br>
    <img src="..\..\Images/img6.jpg" class="lax" data-lax-preset="blurInOut"><br>
<p class="lax" data-lax-preset="blurInOut">Sugary drinks are among the most fattening items you can put into your body.

This is because your brain doesn’t measure calories from liquid sugar the same way it does for solid food.

Therefore, when you drink soda, you end up eating more total calories.

Sugary drinks are strongly associated with obesity, type 2 diabetes, heart disease, and many other health problems.

Keep in mind that certain fruit juices may be almost as bad as soda in this regard, as they sometimes contain just as much sugar. Their small amounts of antioxidants do not negate the sugar’s harmful effects.</p>
<br><br>
<p><b class="lax" data-lax-preset="blurInOut">5. Prepare ahead</b></p><br><br>
    <img src="..\..\Images/img1.jpg" class="lax" data-lax-preset="blurInOut"><br>
<p class="lax" data-lax-preset="blurInOut">Preparing meals in advance gives you the best chance to accomplish your nutrition goals, says Micah LaCerte, a personal trainer and fitness competition world champion. That way, he says, you won’t feel pressured to eat unhealthy foods or skip meals.</p>
<br><br>

<p><b class="lax" data-lax-preset="blurInOut">6. Prepare yourself for endurance training</b></p><br><br>
    <img src="..\..\Images/img7.jpg" class="lax" data-lax-preset="blurInOut"><br>
<p class="lax" data-lax-preset="blurInOut">When it comes to training for endurance, you’ll need to be hydrated and be sure you’re eating properly because, by its very nature, this form of training is very demanding on your body. You should be doing a good mix of cardio and weight training. And, to increase your aerobic capacity, you should incorporate high-intensity interval training, or HIIT. You’ll likely be sweating buckets and burning calories galore, so be prepared.</p>
<br><br>

<p><b class="lax" data-lax-preset="blurInOut">7. Find your motivation</b></p><br><br>
    <img src="..\..\Images/img8.jpg" class="lax" data-lax-preset="blurInOut"><br>
<p class="lax" data-lax-preset="blurOut">Motivation is key. Some good ways to stay motivated while you’re working out: Count down, not up, when performing reps. Another trick: “Look at your dominant hand while you’re pushing up,” Cardiello explains-it “automatically includes a positive reinforcement” because the dominant hand more easily and quickly moves the weight.
